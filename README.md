## Security and Deployment

GitLit can be run on a public server. Private repositories are stored under the repos directory on disk and are not served as static files. Git over HTTP requests are handled by git_http_backend with an authentication layer (Basic auth for Git operations). Access to a private repository over HTTP is denied unless the request is authenticated. Public repositories can be read anonymously; private repositories require authentication.

Important recommendations for running on a public server:
- Do not expose your database to the internet. Bind MongoDB to localhost or a private network and use a firewall.
- Always run behind HTTPS (e.g., via a reverse proxy like Nginx, Caddy, or Traefik). Basic auth must be protected by TLS.
- Keep the repos directory accessible only to the GitLit process user. Do not mount it via a static file server or CDN.
- Keep .env/my.env and other secrets out of version control and out of your web root. They are now ignored in .gitignore by default.
- Use strong, unique passwords. Consider enabling additional factors when implemented.
- Validate that your PORT/address binding matches your threat model (the default binds to localhost; expose explicitly via a reverse proxy).
- Regularly update dependencies and rotate tokens/passwords.

If these practices are followed, storing private repositories on a public server is supported by GitLitâ€™s current design.

## Getting Started

### Usage

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```sh
   cd GitLit
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```sh
   cargo build
   ```

4. **Run the project:**
   ```sh
